      "100.0% the worst mcdonalds ever. complete chaos. the prices are higher than the average and they don't have all of the regular items like lattes or fraps. the staff seems to be uninterested in taking or completing your order. it is as if they are aware that you are pretty much at their mercy.\n",

      "100.0% i was craving fast food - hadn't had it in weeks - so i decided to try this mcdonald's on my lunch break. the food sucked. the nuggets had no taste. grease was dripping from my fries. the ice machine was out of ice. a homeless man was walking around the store begging for money. i think i'm going back to my non-mcdonald's/non-fast food ways.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "100.0% i'm not crazy about this mcdonald's. this is primarily because they are so slow. my gosh what exactly is the hold up? it's fast food people. also, this morning, i guess the worker thought his mic was off, but it wasn't. i now know that he is trying to get as many hours as possible because he needs money bad. spread the word. anyway, this location is on a little access road and you have to go back the way you came because there is no exit from it at the other end. it would have helped if there was one. so, in the end i think i'll avoid this location and find another. this should be easy as there is no shortage of mickey d's in this piece.\n",
      "==================================================\n",

      "100.0% a first for the gf and i - a visit to mcdonald's ! surprisingly, out of the blue, the gf was recovering from the flu and said she was craving mcdonald's french fries. before i could get out the door to make a mickie-d run the gf yells out asking for a filet of fish, \" anything else ? \" , she calls out for a chocolate shake, too. yep, i guess she's feeling better !so i order:large fries - $2.09chocolate shake - $2.79filet of fish - $3.7920 piece chicken nuggets - $4.99diet coke - $1.00my first thought - dang, mickie d's ain't all that cheap, $3.79 for a filet of fish ?! seems high to me.the taste ? holy cow - some of the worst food we've had in a very long time ! my guess is the nuggets were sitting out for several hours - we ate 4 of them and stopped. the fries were limpy, wimpy, limpy. the filet of fish was ok at best. shake was ok. this is a reminder why the only reason i hit mcdonald's is for a soda - best value and basically a safe bet !\n",

      "64.6% out of the thousands of restaurants in vegas, i had to pick a mcdonalds...well, its a cheap eat. its right across the sahara hotel and its design is like one of those classic type mcdonalds back in the 50s, just like scott d. said below. there is nothing special about it. i had gone through the drive-thru at 11:30pm. i was a little scared since there was people playing music loud and just hanging around suspiciously. i had to wait 5-7 minutes for the lady to get back to me on the speaker. it wasn't even crowded inside.anyways, i ordered 2 mcdoubles ($1 each), 2 hot n' spicy ($1 each), 2 bottle water ($1 each), and 2 apple pies (2 for $1), and a large iced tea ($1 each no matter of the size or type of drink). my total was $9.50.nothing special about this place besides the classic car who probably has been waiting for service since forever. oh well, what can you do in the city of sin?!have fun here and keep yelping!!\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "99.8% i like this mcdonalds location, well not really. i just go when i am near the bars along here and just go here with someone. i remember one time a girl i was with in the 3 sheets saloon bar was just dying for a mcdonalds kids meal and i said okay here you go. she really got so excited like she was a kid to get whatever $1.50 value toy they put in there. sometimes they do have deals like one big mac and a medium fries for only $5. it is more expensive if you order separately.\n",
